TODO
====
 * Rewrite tests in test_potential.py to be like test_point_mass_3d()
 * potential.plot() should accept axes and do the right thing when I over-plot on it
 * Clean up plotting in both back_integrate files
 * Update everything to include new Astropy stuff (constants, coordinates...)
 * Papers to read:
     * Longmore, Fernley & Jameson (1986, MNRAS, 220, 279)
     * Madore & Freedman (2011, ApJ, 744, 132)
 * For Brani: If Adrian can write a little Python script that calculates distance from the Sagittarius orbital plane
              for a given RA, Dec, and heliocentric distance, I can select PTF RR Lyrae stars that may be associated
              with Sgr.
 * Email Carl Grillmair Distance vs. RA for the nearest wrap of the SGR simulation data from Law & Majewski 2010
